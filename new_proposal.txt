Objective
---------------------------------------------
Develop an interactive web application that:
- Accepts a researcher's topic proposal as input.
- Matches the proposal to existing Horizon projects based on semantic similarity using NLP.
- Prioritizes matches using both project “objective” text and structured EuroSciVoc topic codes.
- Returns summary statistics about similar projects (e.g., funding scheme, participant count, funding levels).
- Allows users to filter results by funding scheme, year, number of partners, or countries involved.

Data & Methodology
---------------------------------------------
The application is built on the cleaned and structured Cordis Horizon dataset. 
Each project record includes textual objectives, SciVoc classifications, funding data, timelines, and organisation involvement.
Text similarity will be computed using vector embeddings. 
The EuroSciVoc topics will be represented in a structured encoding (e.g., one-hot), with their importance weighted higher in the similarity computation. 
Filtering and summary logic will use Pandas and Scikit-Learn pipelines.

Technical Stack
---------------------------------------------
- Vectorization & similarity: scikit-learn, sentence-transformers, numpy
- Backend logic: pandas, scikit-learn, networkx 
- UI: Shiny for Python (interactive filtering, user input, outputs)
- Deployment: AWS EC2 or shinyapps.io, with future potential for containerized deployment via Docker

Outcome
---------------------------------------------
A researcher-facing web interface that intelligently recommends comparable Horizon projects based on a custom topic idea. 
This tool provides visibility into relevant funding schemes, historical award sizes, collaboration footprints, and strategic positioning — ultimately supporting better-targeted research proposals.
